EDB provides a graphical interactive installer for Windows. You can access it two ways:

- Download the graphical installer from the [Downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#migration-toolkit) and invoke the installer directly. See [Installing directly](#installing-directly).

- Use Stack Builder (with PostgreSQL) or StackBuilder Plus (with EDB Postgres Advanced Server) to download the EDB installer package and invoke the graphical installer.  See [Using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus](#using-stack-builder-or-stackbuilder-plus).


## Prerequisites

You must have a Java JVM (version 1.8.0 or later) in place before Stack Builder can perform a Migration Toolkit installation. 

You must also set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable based on the location where you installed Java. For MacOS version 10.15 and later, use the following command to set the variable:

`echo export "JAVA_HOME=\$(/usr/libexec/java_home)" >> ~/.zshrc`


## Installing directly

After downloading the graphical installer, to start the installation wizard, assume sufficient privileges (superuser or administrator) and double-click the installer icon. If prompted, provide a password.

Proceed to the [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer) section in this topic.

After installing Migration Toolkit, you must install the appropriate JDBC drivers before performing a migration. See [Installing a JDBC driver](/migration_toolkit/latest/installing/installing_jdbc_driver/) for more information.

!!! Note
    The EDB JDBC driver is not available for Mac OS.
