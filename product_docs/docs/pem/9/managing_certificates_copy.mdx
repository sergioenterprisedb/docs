PEM, by default, supports secured SSL/TLS connections and acts as its own certificate authority (CA) to generate certificates and keys for the PEM server and agent. 

The SSL CA certificates and keys for the PEM server and agent gets generated during the PEM installation. These certificates and keys encrypt the connections between them. You can replace the PEM self-signed CA certificate and key with trusted third-party CA certificates.

## PEM self-signed CA certificate framework

The PEM server configuration script generates self-signed CA certificates and key files for the PEM backend database server. The backend database server uses these certificates and keys to authenticate and encrypt the agent connections.

The PEM server generates the certificates and key files in the data directory of the backend database server:

- `ca_certificate.crt`
- `ca_key.key`
- `root.crt`
- `root.crl`
- `server.crt`
- `server.key`

Note that the `ca_certificate.crt` and `ca_key.key` (self-signed CA certificates and key) files are used during the agent registration process to generate SSL certificates and key files for the agent. The `root.crt` file is a copy of the `ca_certificate.crt` file and used as the root certificate for the backend database server, for example, set as `ssl_ca_file` in the `postgresql.conf`.

Before you begin to configure PEM Self-signed CA certificates and keys, see PostgreSQL’s  [Secure TCP/IP Connections with SSL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ssl-tcp.html) for additional information about how to configure SSL on the server side. 

### PEM self-signed CA certificate expiration

The expiration date of the `ca_certificate.crt` file is monitored by the PEM agent installed with the PEM server. When the certificate is about to expire, PEM performs the following steps:

- Make a backup of the existing certificate files
- Create new certificate files, appending the new CA certificate file to the `root.crt` file on the PEM server
- Create a job that renews the certificate file of any active agents
- Restarts the PEM server

If you uninstall an agent, the certificate associated with that agent is added to the certificate revocation list maintained in the `root.crl` file to ensure you can't use the certificate to connect to the PEM server.

## Generating agent and server certificates and key

You must generate a certificate and rsa key for each agent interacting with the PEM server and copy the key and certificate to the agent.

Each agent has a unique identifier that is stored in the `pem.agent` table of the PEM database. You must replace the key and certificate files with the key or certificate that corresponds to the agent's identifier. 

In addition, you should move the `agent.key` and `agent.crt` files generated in the following steps 2 and 3 into place on their respective PEM agent host before generating the next certificate and key file pair.

Perform the following steps to generate a PEM agent certificate and key file pair:

1.  Use psql to find the number of agents and their corresponding identifiers:

    ```shell
    /usr/pgsql-x/bin/psql -U postgres -d pem --no-psqlrc -t -A -c "SELECT ID FROM pem.agent"
    ```

-   On Linux, you can also find the agent identifier and location of the keys and certificates in the `PEMagent` section of the `/etc/postgres-reg.ini` file.

-   On Windows, the information is stored in the registry:

    -   On a 64-bit Windows installation, check:

    ```shell
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\EnterpriseDB\PEM\agent
    ```

    -   On a 32-bit Windows installation, check:

    ```shell
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\EnterpriseDB\PEM\agent
    ```

2.  After identifying the agents that need key files, generate an `agent.key` for each agent. To generate the key, execute the following command, capturing the output in a file:

    ```shell
    /usr/pgsql-x/bin/psql -U postgres -d pem --no-psqlrc -t -A -c "SELECT openssl_rsa_generate_key(1024)" > agent.key
    ```

    Modify the privileges of the `agent.key` file:

    ```shell
    chmod 600 agent.key
    ```

3.  To generate a certificate for each agent, execute the following command, capturing the output in a certificate file:

    ```shell
    /usr/pgsql-x/bin/psql -U postgres -d pem --no-psqlrc -t -A -c
    "SELECT openssl_csr_to_crt(openssl_rsa_key_to_csr('$(cat agent.key)',
    'agent<$ID>', 'US', 'MA', 'Bedford', 'Postgres Enterprise Manager',
    'support@enterprisedb.com'),
    '/var/lib/pgsql/x/data/ca_certificate.crt',
    '/var/lib/pgsql/x/data/ca_key.key')" > agent.crt
    ```

    Where `$ID` is the agent number of the agent (retrieved by the psql command line).

4.  Modify the privileges of the `agent.crt` file:

    ```shell
    chmod 600 agent.crt
    ```

### Replacing agent’s existing certificate and key files with newly generated files

You must replace each agent's existing certificates and key file with the newly generated files before restarting the PEM agent service:

- Linux
    -   On Linux with `init.d`, restart the service with the command:

    ```shell
    /etc/init.d/pemagent start
    ```

    -   On Linux with `systemd`, restart the service with the command:

    ```shell
    systemctl start pemagent
    ```

- Windows
    - On a Windows host, you can use the Services applet to start the PEM agent. The PEM agent service is named Postgres Enterprise Manager Agent. Select the service name in the Services dialog box and select **Start the service**.

## Replacing agent SSL certificates

You can update the self-signed SSL certificates on an existing PEM installation. If you upgrade your server to a new version simultaneously, invoke all PEM installers (first the server installer, then agent installers) before replacing the SSL certificates. 

Perform the following steps to update the self-signed SSL certificates:

1.  Stop all running PEM agents, first on the server host, and then on any monitored node.

    To stop a PEM agent on a Linux host, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

    On Linux with `systemd`, for example, Centos 7 or 8

    ```shell
    systemctl stop pemagent
    ```

    On a Windows host, you can use the Services applet to stop the PEM agent. The PEM agent service is named Postgres Enterprise Manager Agent. Select the service name in the Services dialog box and select **Stop the service**.

2.  Take a backup of the existing SSL certificates and keys. The SSL certificates and keys are stored in the `data` directory under your PEM installation. For example, the default location on a Linux system is:

    `/var/lib/pgsql/x/data`, where `x` is the PostgreSQL database version

    Copy the following files, adding an extension to each file to make the name unique:

    -   `ca_certificate.crt`
    -   `ca_key.key`
    -   `root.crt`
    -   `root.crl`
    -   `server.key`
    -   `server.crt`

    For example, to creates a backup of the `ca_certificate` file with the word `old` appended to the entry, use this command:

    ```shell
    # cp ca_certificate.crt ca_certificate_old.crt
    ```    

3.  Use the `openssl_rsa_generate_key()` function to generate the `ca_key.key` file:

    ```shell
    /usr/pgsql-x.x/bin/psql -U postgres -d pem --no-psqlrc -t -A -c "SELECT public.openssl_rsa_generate_key(1024)" > /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/ca_key.key
    ```

    After creating the `ca_key.key` file, `cat` the contents to the variable `CA_KEY` for use when generating the `ca_certificate.crt` file. Modify the privileges on the `ca_key.key` file:

    ```shell
    CA_KEY=$(cat /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/ca_key.key)

    chmod 600 /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/ca_key.key
    ```

4.  Use the key to generate the `ca_certificate.crt` file. For simplicity, place the SQL query in a temporary file with a unique name:

    ```shell
    echo "SELECT openssl_csr_to_crt(openssl_rsa_key_to_csr('${CA_KEY}',
    'PEM','US', 'MA', 'Bedford', 'Postgres Enterprise Manager',
    'support@enterprisedb.com'), NULL,
    '/var/lib/pgsql/x/data/ca_key.key')" > /tmp/_random.$$
    ```

    Then use the variable to execute the query, placing the content in the `ca_certificate.crt` file.

    ```shell
    /usr/pgsql-x/bin/psql -U postgres -d pem --no-psqlrc -t -A -f /tmp/_random.$$ > /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/ca_certificate.crt
    ```

    Modify the permissions of the `ca_certificate.crt` file, and remove the temporary file that contained the SQL command:

    ```shell
    chmod 600 /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/ca_certificate.crt

    rm -f /tmp/_random.$$
    ```

5.  Reuse the `ca_certificate.crt` file as the `root.crt` file:

    ```shell
    cp /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/ca_certificate.crt /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/root.crt
    ```

    Modify the permissions of the `root.crt` file:

    ```shell
    chmod 600 /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/root.crt
    ```

6.  Use the `openssl_rsa_generate_crl()` function to create the certificate revocation list (`root.crl`):

    ```shell
    /usr/pgsql-x/bin/psql -U postgres -d pem --no-psqlrc -t -A -c
     "SELECT openssl_rsa_generate_crl('/var/lib/pgsql/x/data/ca_certificate.crt', '/var/lib/pgsql/x/data/ca_key.key')" > /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/root.crl
    ```

    Modify the permissions of the `root.crl` file:

    ```shell
    chmod 600 /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/root.crl
    ```

7.  Use the `openssl_rsa_generate_key()` function to generate the `server.key` file:

    ```shell
    /usr/pgsql-x/bin/psql -U postgres -d pem --no-psqlrc -t -A -c "SELECT public.openssl_rsa_generate_key(1024)" >> /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/server.key
    ```

    After creating the `server.key` file, `cat` the contents to the variable `SSL_KEY` for use when generating the `server.crt` file and modify the privileges on the `server.key` file:

    ```shell
    SSL_KEY=$(cat /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/server.key)

    chmod 600 /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/server.key
    ```

8.  Use the `SSL_KEY` to generate the server certificate. Save the certificate in the `server.crt` file. For simplicity, first place the SQL query into a temporary file with a unique name:

    ```shell
    echo "SELECT openssl_csr_to_crt(openssl_rsa_key_to_csr('${SSL_KEY}',
    'PEM','US', 'MA', 'Bedford', 'Postgres Enterprise Manager',
    'support@enterprisedb.com'),
    '/var/lib/pgsql/x/data/ca_certificate.crt',
    '/var/lib/pgsql/x/data/ca_key.key')" > /tmp/_random.$$

     /usr/pgsql-x/bin/psql -U postgres -d pem --no-psqlrc -t -A -f /tmp/_random.$$ >> /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/server.crt
    ```

9.  Modify the privileges on the `server.crt` file, and delete the temporary file:

    ```shell
    chmod 600 /var/lib/pgsql/x/data/server.crt

    rm -f /tmp/_random.$$
    ```

10. Restart the Postgres server:

       On Linux with `init.d`, for example, on a Centos6 host:

    ```shell
    /etc/init.d/postgresql-x restart
    ```

    On Linux with `systemd`, for example, on a Centos7 host:

    ```shell
    systemctl restart postgresql-x
    ```

## Replacing PEM self-signed certificates and keys with trusted CA-signed certificates and keys

Before replacing the PEM self-signed certificates and keys with the trusted third-party CA certificates and keys, you must get those certificates using the steps indicated in the third-party CA. 

After obtaining the trusted third-party CA certificates and keys, perform the following steps: 

- Replace PEM self-signed certificates and keys with trusted CA-signed certificates and keys
- Install trusted CA root and intermediate certificates
- Install trusted CA CRL
- Disable CRL usage by the server if the trusted third-party CA does not provide CRL
- Configuring different agents to use a shared database role
