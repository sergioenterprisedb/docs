PEM supports self-signed SSL certificates:

- Webserver(HTTPD)
- PEM agent and backend database server connection

## Webserver certificates

We recommend an additional layer of SSL security for the web application.

PEM uses the self-signed SSL certificates for the Apache/HTTPD server. The self-signed SSL certificates and keys for the Apache/HTTPD server get generated during the PEM installation.

If you want to use your own SSL certificate for PEM, you must update the Apache configuration file.

On Linux, you need to open the Apache HTTPD configuration file (`edb-ssl-pem.conf`) in a text editor and be a user with write permission on the file. You must also change the server name and file names in the configuration file to match your certificate files.

Update these two SSL directives in the PEM VirtualHost section:

-   `SSLCertificateFile` is your DigiCert certificate file (for example, your_domain_name.crt).
-   `SSLCertificateKeyFile` is the .key file generated when you created the CSR (for example, your_private.key).

For example, make the following updates:

```shell
SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateFile /path/to/your_domain_name.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/your_private.key
```

You can also replace the HTTPD self-signed SSL certificates with trusted CA-signed certificates in PEM. For more information, see [Replacing HTTPD self-signed SSL certificates](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/how-replacing-httpd-self-signed-ssl-certificates-trusted-ca-signed-certificates).

## PEM server and agent connection certificates

PEM, by default, supports secured SSL/TLS connections and acts as its own certificate authority (CA) to generate certificates and keys for the PEM server and agent. The self-signed SSL certificates and keys for the PEM server and agent get generated during the PEM installation. These certificates and keys encrypt the connections between the server and the agent. 

To increase the security, you can replace the PEM self-signed CA certificate and key with trusted third-party CA certificates. For more information, see [Trusted third-party CA certificates and keys](/pem/latest/certificates/#trusted-third-party-ca-certificates-and-keys).

### How PEM self-signed SSL certificates work

The PEM server configuration script generates self-signed SSL certificates and key files for the PEM backend database server. The backend database server uses these certificates and keys to authenticate and encrypt the agent connections. If you upgrade your PEM server, you need to replace the SSL certificates. For more information, see [Regenerating server self-signed SSL certificates](/pem/latest/certificates/replacing_ssl_certificates).

The PEM agent acts as a client of the PEM backend database server. It connects using the libpq interface. The client side self-signed SSL certificates and keys get generated during the [PEM registration](/pem/latest/registering_agent). PEM agent establishes the connection with the PEM backend database server using the self-signed SSL certificate and key files. 

Each agent has a unique identifier and the agent certificates and keys have the corresponding identifier mentioned. Each certificate has an expiry date. You can regenerate the certificates when it gets expired. For more information, see [Regenerating agent self-signed SSL certificates](/pem/latest/certificates/regenerating_agent_certificates).


For more information on using the SSL certificates to connect in Postgres, see [Securing TCP/IP connections with SSL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ssl-tcp.html).

### Certificate and key files generation

The PEM server generates the certificates and key files in the data directory of the backend database server:

- `ca_certificate.crt`
- `ca_key.key`
- `root.crt`
- `root.crl`
- `server.crt`
- `server.key`

The `ca_certificate.crt` and `ca_key.key` are used during the agent registration process to generate the agent's SSL certificates and key files.

The `root.crt` file is a copy of the `ca_certificate.crt` file. You use the root certificate for the backend database server by setting the `ssl_ca_file` parameter as `root.crt` in the postgresql.conf file.

The `root.crl` file maintains the certificate revocation list of the agents. It ensures that the certificates associated with uninstalled agents are not in use.

The `server.crt` is the signed certificate for the PEM server and the `server.key` is the private key to the certificate. The PEM agent certificates get generated using this server certificate and key files.

### PEM self-signed SSL certificate renewal

The PEM agent installed with the PEM server monitors the expiration date of the `ca_certificate.crt` file. When the certificate is about to expire, PEM performs these steps:

- Makes a backup of the existing certificate files
- Creates new certificate files and appends the new CA certificate file to the `root.crt` file on the PEM server
- Creates a job to renew the certificate file of any active agents
- Restarts the PEM server

If you uninstall an agent, the certificate associated with the agent gets added to the certificate revocation list maintained in the `root.crl` file. This ensures you can't use the certificate to connect to the PEM server.

## Trusted third-party CA certificates and keys

You can replace the PEM self-signed SSL certificates and keys with the trusted third-party CA certificates and keys. 

After obtaining the trusted third-party CA certificates and keys, perform the following steps: 

- Replace PEM self-signed certificates and keys with trusted CA-signed certificates and keys
- Disable CRL usage by the server if the trusted third-party CA does not provide CRL

### Replace the server self-signed SSL certificates with the trusted third-party CA certificates:

1. Take the backup of old server certificate and key files:

   ```shell
   # Running as root
   mkdir /var/lib/edb/as<x>/data/certs
   cd /var/lib/edb/as<x>/data/
   mv server.* root.* ca_* /var/lib/edb/as<x>/data/certs
   ```

1. Generate a private key for the server:

   ```shell
   openssl genrsa -out server.key 4096 
   ```

1. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the server:

   ```shell
   openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj '/C=IN/ST=MH/L=Pune/O=EDB/CN=PEM'
   ```
   
   Where `-subj` can be provided as per your requirements. You can define `CN` as hostname/domain name of the PEM server host.
   
1. Obtain the third-party CA certificate (`ca_ceritificate.crt`) from a trusted certificate authority (CA). 

1. Ask your CA to sign the CSR and generate the server certificate for you. 

1. Verify the details of the new server certificate aren't tampered with and match your provided details.

   ```shell
   openssl x509 -noout -text -in server.crt
   ```

1. Reuse the `ca_certificate.crt` file as the `root.crt` file:

   ```shell
   cp ca_certificate.crt root.crt
   ```

1. Copy new `ca_certificate.crt`,`root.crt`, `server.key`, and `server.crt` to the data directory of the backend database server:

   ```shell
   cp ca_ceritificate.crt root.crt server.key server.crt /var/lib/edb/as<x>/data
   ```

1. Change the owner and permissions of new certificates and key files:

    ```shell
    cd /var/lib/edb/as<x>/data/
    chown enterprisedb server.* root.crt ca_certificate.crt
    chmod 600 server.* root.crt ca_certificate.crt
    ```

    Do not restart the PEM server at this point

1. Replace each PEM agent SSL certificates with the trusted third-party CA certificates. For more information, see this [section](/pem/latest/certificates/#replace-the-agent-self-signed-ssl-certificates-with-the-trusted-third-party-ca-certificates).

1. Restart the PEM server:

   - On Linux,

   ```shell
   # Running as root
   systemctl start edb-as-<x>
   ```

   Restarting the backend database server, restarts the PEM server.

### Replace the agent self-signed SSL certificates with the trusted third-party CA certificates:

1. Use psql to find the number of agents and their corresponding identifiers:

   ```shell
   /usr/edb/as<x>/bin/psql -U enerprisedb -d pem --no-psqlrc -t -A -c "SELECT ID FROM pem.agent WHERE agent='true'"
   ```

1. After identifying the agents that need key files, generate an `agent<ID>.key` for each agent. To generate the key, execute the command:

   ```shell
   openssl genrsa -out agent<ID>.key 4096 
   ```

1. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for each agent:

   ```shell
   openssl req -new -key agent<ID>.key -out agent<ID>.csr -subj '/C=IN/ST=MH/L=Pune/O=PEM/CN=agent<ID>'
   ```
   
   Where `CN` is `agent<ID>`.

1. Ask your CA to sign the CSR and generate agent certificate for you. 

1. Change the permission on the new `agent<ID>.crt` and `agent<ID>.key` file:

    ```shell
    chmod 600 agent<ID>.crt agent<ID>.key
    ```

1. Take backup of old agent certificate and key file:

   ```shell
   # Running as root
   mkdir root/.pem/certs
   mv root/.pem/agent<ID>.* root/.pem/certs
   ```

1. Replace each agent's certificate and key file with the newly generated files. 
   
   ```shell
   cp agent<ID>.key agent<ID>.crt root/.pem
   ```

7. Restart the PEM agent service:

   - On Linux,

   ```shell
   # Running as root
   systemctl start pemagent
   ```

   - On Windows, you can use the Services applet to start the PEM agent. The PEM agent service is named Postgres Enterprise Manager Agent. Select the service name in the Services dialog box and select **Start the service**.
