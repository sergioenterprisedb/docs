title: Working with extensions
---

BigAnimal supports a number of Postgres extensions.

- See [Postgres extensions available by deployment](/pg_extensions/) for the complete list of extensions BigAnimal supports.

- See [Postgres extensions](/biganimal/release/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/extensions) for more information on installing and working with extensions.

## EDB Postgres extensions
A number of the extensions are developed and maintained by EDB. These include:

- [EDB Advanced Storage Pack](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/) &mdash; provides advanced storage options for PostgreSQL databases in the form of table access method (TAM) extensions. These storage options can enhance the performance and reliability of databases without requiring application changes. 

  The TAM extensions included in the Advanced Storage Pack include:

  - [Autocluster](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/#autocluster) &mdash; provides faster access to clustered data by keeping track of the last inserted row for any value in a side table. 

  - [Refdata](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/#refdata) &mdash; can provide performance gains of 5-10% and increased scalability.
- [EDB Postgres Tuner](/pg_extensions/pg_tuner/) &mdash;  provides safe recommendations that maximize the use of available resources. 


## Foreign data wrappers

BigAnimal supports the mongo_fdw and mysql_fdw open source foreign data wrapper extensions. They allow you to connect your Postgres database server to external data sources.

BigAnimal also supports enhanced versions of the corresponding PostgreSQL extensions intended to support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities.

- [MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper](/mongo_data_adapter/latest/) &mdash;  accesses data that resides on a MongoDB database from a Postgres database server

- [MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper](/mysql_data_adapter/latest/) &mdash;  accesses data that resides on a MySQL database from a Postgres database server
